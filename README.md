A collection of useful HDAs, Tools and Scripts for SideFX Houdini.

LFos is a collection of tools I've come to rely on and would like to share with the houdini community. It's inspired by other artist's and studio workflows, with some tools that have been iterated on for a few years now. Any asset that proves to be useful from a project I try to repurpose into a tool here. Work in progress assets are currently hidden from the tab menu.

Feedback and Requests are very welcome.

* Copy the LFos.json file into the packages folder
* Edit the json file to point to the LFos parent directory
